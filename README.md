# PDF-Word-Cloud-Generator-using-Python
My Internship project on Word-Cloud Generator

Here, I have created a project which helps us create a Word Cloud from a given PDF. 
The only limitation of it is that the pdf uploaded should be small and not very large

# What is a Word Cloud?
Word Clouds are basically images with different designs which show the different words present in the input document. The difference lies in their sizes (which depend on their frequencies of occurance, removing articals and grammatical WORDS like their, is, an ,the,etc...), which means that if a word "Python" is repeted continuously in a document, it is shown with the largest size/font and if a word "Code" repeats the least, then its size in the image will be relatively smaller! For examples of word clouds, refer: https://www.google.com/search?q=word+cloud&rlz=1C1CHBD_enIN837IN837&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjS5OO2yaLrAhUJyzgGHbBuDvAQ_AUoAXoECA0QAw&biw=1536&bih=743&dpr=1.25
